# Mathematical Notation Language

This repository will be the main source of documentation behind MNL.  
MNL is a conceptual notation potentially to be made into a functional programming language.

## Goals
As mathematicians that enjoy programming and programmers that enjoy mathematics, we want
a notation that allows us to type out our mathematics without TeX or lots of brackets (This isn't Lisp!)
We also don't want to over-complicate things, so we'll strip down a lot of the duplicates and context-grammars in the Standard Notation.

Another thing that would want to do is convert MNL to Standard Notation through an intermediate language to your favourite maths libraries,
such as TeX or SVG. From there you can go to PDF with one of the countless systems.

As mentioned above, we're all programmers here. It would be useful to have a system like wolfram alpha to parse MNL files
and get out a new MNL file with solutions or simplified versions of functions, expressions and equations.
