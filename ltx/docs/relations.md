# Relations

This document contains our notation system for relations.

## Equivalence / Equating 

This is your standard use of equals. It is used to denote equivalence between two statements,
e.g. 3+2 = 1+4. It is written and typed as a normal equals (=).

## Identity

Again, this is the same as in standard notation. It is used to denote an identity or
congruence, that is, two statements that will always be equivalent, e.g. sin^2(x)
+ cos^2(x) == 1. It is written as an equals with an extra line and typed as a double
equals (==).

## Declaration / assignment

This is already present in standard notation, however we define it with a more rigorous
purpose. It is used to declare a variable as a certain value, e.g. x := 5. It is used
in all cases where you assign a value to a variable. It is written and typed
as a colon-equals (:=). 

## Approximation

Again already present in standard notation, approximation is denoting that one
statement is approximately equal to another. In written forms it is two tilde, 
in typed form a tilde (~). In function form, a ~> is used.

## Application / evaluation

Evaluation is the process of evaluating a statement. E.g. working out the value of
f(5) (where f is a function). Given f(x) := x^2, then f(5) -> 25. Equally,
when evaluating an integral from S x dx to [(x^2)/2]\_0^1, a -> is used.
