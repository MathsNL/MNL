# Relations

This document contains our notation system for relations.

## Equivalence / Equating / Evaluation

This is your standard use of equals. It is used to denote equivalence between two statements,
e.g. 3+2 = 1+4. It is written and typed as a normal equals (=). This is also used when evaluating
a statement or function, such as int(y)[x] = (y^2)/2, or f(5) = 10 (given f(x) := 2x)

## Identity

Again, this is the same as in standard notation. It is used to denote an identity or
congruence, that is, two statements that will always be equivalent, e.g. 
`sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) == 1`. It is written as an equals with an extra line and typed as a double
equals (==).

## Declaration / assignment

This is already present in standard notation, however we define it with a more rigorous
purpose. It is used to declare a variable as a certain value, e.g. x := 5. It is used
in all cases where you assign a value to a variable. It is written and typed
as a colon-equals (:=). 

## Approximation

Again already present in standard notation, approximation is denoting that one
statement is approximately equal to another. In written forms it is two tilde, 
in typed form a tilde (~). In function form, a ~> is used.
